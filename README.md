# Crop-Area-Estimation
 Collaborated with WASSAN, an NGO, to develop a solution for agricultural area estimation using high-resolution  orthomosaic drone images.â€“ Applied VGG16 to classify land use into categories such as plantation vs.  non-plantation,  and further identify the plantation count and even health condition like Dead, good or stunted using the yolo models.
